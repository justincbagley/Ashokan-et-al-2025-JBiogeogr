## MENDELEY DATA ACCESSION DESCRIPTION

In support of the manuscript by Ashokan et al. (2025), this accession attempts to provide information, code, and data files used in our study. Specifically, the accession contains the following data files and folders: (1) the "n138_RAxML_concatenated_seqs_1per_nopart_GTRG_b100/" folder contains input files, run files, and results files for our concatenated maximum likelihood (CAML) tree analysis under maximum likelihood in RAxMLwas the main topology in this study and the topology from which the chronogram used in the phylogenetic comparative method (PCM) analyses was derived. (2) The "n138_RAxML_trees_and_R_timetree_analysis_code-files/" folder contains the input CAML tree, R code, and R analysis and output files from our time tree calibration analysis using the 'chronos' function in R.

Given uncertainty regarding Elsevier's discontinuation of Data Monitor and other possible effects on the accessibility of Mendeley Data, a mirror of this accession is being created on GitHub at the following URL: <https://github.com/justincbagley/Ashokan-et-al-2025-JBiogeogr>. Users are redirected there for the most up-to-date version of this accession. However, are also encouraged to refer to the manuscript and supplementary files available on the journal website for additional information on how the data were generated, analyzed, and interpreted.
